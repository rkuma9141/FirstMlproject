# 🎯 Placement Prediction using Machine Learning

This is my first Machine Learning project where I built a model to predict whether a student will get placed or not based on academic and personal profile data.

## 📌 Objective

To predict student placement status using various features such as:
- Gender
- Stream
- CGPA
- Internship experience
- Technical skills
- Communication skills

## 📁 Dataset Description

- Source: Placement dataset (CSV file)
- Total records: XYZ
- Features:
  - Gender
  - Stream
  - CGPA
  - Internships
  - History of Backlogs
  - Communication Skills
  - Placement Status (Target)

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy – for data preprocessing
- Matplotlib, Seaborn – for EDA and visualization
- Scikit-learn – for ML modeling
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Machine Learning Models

Applied and tested the following ML models:
- Logistic Regression ✅
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Support Vector Machine

✅ *Best Model:* Logistic Regression with accuracy of *XX%*

## 🔍 Data Preprocessing Steps

- Handled missing values
- Converted categorical to numerical (Label Encoding)
- Feature scaling (StandardScaler)
- Removed outliers and performed EDA

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report
- Cross-validation

## 📷 Visualizations

- Countplots for categorical features
- Heatmap of feature correlations
- Distribution of CGPA
- Placement distribution (class balance)
